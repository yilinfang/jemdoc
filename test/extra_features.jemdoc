Bobby was a busy bee who worked hard to collect pollen from the flowers. \n
He liked to fly from one flower to another and fill his basket with yellow dust. \n
He was proud of his job and his hive.\n
One day, he saw a new flower. \n
It was big and red, and it smelled very sweet. \n
Bobby was attracted to it. \n
He flew over to it and landed on its petals.\n
He was about to take some pollen when he heard a voice.\n
"Hello, who are you?" the voice said.\n
Bobby looked around and saw that the flower had a face. \n
It had two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.\n
"I'm Bobby," he said.\n
"I'm Ruby," the flower said.\n
"What are you doing here?" she asked.\n
"I'm collecting pollen," he said.\n
"Oh, I see. Do you like my pollen?" she asked.\n
"Yes, it's very nice," he said.\n
"Thank you. You're very kind," she said.\n
Bobby felt happy. \n
He had made a new friend. \n
He decided to stay with her for a while and chat.\n
