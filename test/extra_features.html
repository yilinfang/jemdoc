<td><p>Bobby was a busy bee who worked hard to collect pollen from the flowers. <br />
He liked to fly from one flower to another and fill his basket with yellow dust. <br />
He was proud of his job and his hive.<br />
One day, he saw a new flower. <br />
It was big and red, and it smelled very sweet. <br />
Bobby was attracted to it. <br />
He flew over to it and landed on its petals.<br />
He was about to take some pollen when he heard a voice.<br />
&ldquo;Hello, who are you?&rdquo; the voice said.<br />
Bobby looked around and saw that the flower had a face. <br />
It had two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.<br />
&ldquo;I'm Bobby,&rdquo; he said.<br />
&ldquo;I'm Ruby,&rdquo; the flower said.<br />
&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she asked.<br />
&ldquo;I'm collecting pollen,&rdquo; he said.<br />
&ldquo;Oh, I see. Do you like my pollen?&rdquo; she asked.<br />
&ldquo;Yes, it's very nice,&rdquo; he said.<br />
&ldquo;Thank you. You're very kind,&rdquo; she said.<br />
Bobby felt happy. <br />
He had made a new friend. <br />
He decided to stay with her for a while and chat.<br />
